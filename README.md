# Mergeable heap using linked lists implementation in C
 
The solution to problem 10-2 from the book "Introduction to Algorithms" by Cormen.

The problem is:
`A mergeable heap supports the following operations: MAKE-HEAP (which creates an empty mergeable heap), INSERT, MINIMUM, EXTRACT-MIN, and UNION. Show how to implement mergeable heaps using linked lists in each of the following cases. Try to make each operation as efficient as possible. Analyze the running time of each operation in terms of the size of the dynamic set(s) being operated on.

Lists are sorted.
Lists are unsorted.
Lists are unsorted, and dynamic sets to be merged are disjoint.`
